[Choosing Investment Managers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3651476) (with Amit Goyal and M. Deniz Yavuz)

Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Forthcoming

Abstract

We study how plan sponsors choose investment management firms from their opportunity set
when delegating $1.6 trillion in assets between 2002 and 2017. Choice is related to (i) pre-hiring
returns, and (ii) pre-existing connections between personnel at the plan (or investment
consultant), and the investment management firm. Ex post, connections do not result in higher
post-hiring returns. Relationships are thus conducive to asset gathering by investment managers
but do not generate commensurate pecuniary benefits for plan sponsors.
