I supervise three Student Investment Management (SIM) Funds that manage assets from [ASU
Enterprise Partners](https://asuenterprisepartners.org/).
- As a precursor to the SIM Fund, students take a Portfolio Engineering course from me
which links the financial science to live asset management.
- SIM funds are not stock-picker funds but are managed quantitatively, typically
implementing highly technical investment strategies derived from cutting edge published
academic research that the students are required to read and absorb.
- These are systematic, evidence-based investment strategies that require students to
understand the financial science, and work with large quantities of data, and program up
solutions in Matlab, Python, and other such frameworks.
- Post-seeding, students handle rebalancing requirements, do weekly “client-style”
presentations on performance, attribution, etc.
- In the past, students have implemented strategies that are variants of value, profitability,
idiosyncratic volatility, low volatility, downside risk, accruals, dividend predictability,
insider trading, carbon-neutral, etc.
- Samples of the investment strategies are available here:
  - [UG](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/finance-degrees/investment-management )
  - [MBA](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/finance-degrees/mba-investment-management-fund)

SIM alumni are amazing and represented at major asset managers, hedge funds, family offices,
RIAs and graduate schools.
